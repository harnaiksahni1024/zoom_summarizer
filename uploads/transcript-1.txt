00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Host: Welcome everyone, today we’ll review the Q2 project updates.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.200
Alice: Thanks for organizing this meeting. I’ll start with the marketing campaign…

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:20.500
Alice: …we’ve seen a 15% leap in engagement since we launched the new ad creatives.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.000
Bob: That’s impressive. Have you tracked conversions from those channels?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:35.000
Alice: Yes. Over the last three weeks, conversions rose from 2.3% to 3.1%, mainly via social media.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.000
Host: Great. Charlie, how are we doing on the product roadmap?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:55.000
Charlie: We’re finalizing the beta release for the dashboard tool. The UI is 90% complete. We're targeting early August for soft launch.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:05.000
Denise: Will that include user analytics? We need that for client feedback.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.000
Charlie: Yes, core metrics are incorporated. We’re integrating Heatmap and Session Replay before launch.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:25.000
Bob: Any blockers on the backend side?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.000
Charlie: Just a data‑sync issue with legacy DB. We expect to fix that by next week.

… [continues up to 00:20:00]

Host: Okay, let’s recap action items.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.000

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.000
