Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: and that is the item number 3, which I understand is
focused specifically on the police officer rates. But I see that the subject line is actually revised the
city's publicly available pay schedule. My question to staff is just a confirmation that the salary
rates that we see in this in the staff report reflect salaries that have already been approved by our
city council.
80
00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.780

17078248417: to me that that Ron Nelson, our our current police chief, our retiring police chief,
mentioned that he was going to be here for for only 2 years. And so, anyway, why is it that you all
didn't start talking about looking for a replacement until, like the last City council meeting, it just
goes to show how how
87
00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:22.580
17078248417: blatantly and awfully dysfunctional this city council in the past one was, you know
with with Nisa and and our mayor leading the way in in dysfunctionality. Also, while we're at it, you
know. Once again, you know. Who would wanna, who would want to be badgered, bullied, vilified,

17078248417: chief of this wonderful town, who, unfortunately, the cops spend, as you know, 50%
of their time in dealing with the homeless. It doesn't seem like a desirable position to me, and, in
fact, as you know, 3 3 of our officers, including one of our past police chiefs, voted with their feet,
and they all up and quit.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:20.140
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: So item number 5 is an item that is being introduced by
our city manager.
107
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.920
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Yes, thank you. So I'm going to go ahead and share my
screen and have a very brief Powerpoint.
108
00:16:25.642 --> 00:16:26.789
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: To walk through.
109

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.760
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Okay.
110
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.160
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: so
111
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.790
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: this is about the sales tax, the use of the sales tax.
112
00:16:43.442 --> 00:16:47.890
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Dollars. 1.5 million approximately. If the half cent sales tax
passes.
113
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.010
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the policy indicates council intent.
114
00:16:52.645 --> 00:17:03.620
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: But because it's actually not part of the ballot measure,
the measure itself remains a general tax as opposed to a specific tax. If the ballot measure
allocated the dollars
115
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:12.159
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: to particular uses. But this is different than that. This is a
policy that can be changed, but it does provide an indication of how you intend to spend
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
116
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.479
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the money. And again, we'll generate about 1.5 million a
year
117
00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:17.819
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: at the half cent level.
118
00:17:20.436 --> 00:17:24.593
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: The suggested policy options are in the report along with a
couple of alternatives.
119
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.749
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the first, st and this has gone through the Budget
Committee.
120
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.169
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the 1st recommendation is to develop a 3rd of it.
121
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:38.249
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: about 500,000 a year to high priority, infrastructure of
roads, streets, drainage, and parks.
122
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:45.910
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: The second is to ensure that we retain existing staff in the
police department and provide sufficient funding
123
00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:48.159
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: in the fire reorganization.
124
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.609
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Assuming that we do the reorganization with Gold Ridge
125
00:17:52.298 --> 00:17:58.050
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the 3rd option or part of the option is to potentially use the
money to add staff.
126
00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:02.179
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: We are recommend at least noting it as a need.
127
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:07.759
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: We do know we need staff across most departments and
then consider the specifics
128
00:18:08.256 --> 00:18:13.469
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: after we do the staffing study anticipated for early next
year, and then during the Budget cycle.
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
129
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.860
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: This is where the Budget Committee members disagreed.
130
00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:27.650
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Council member Mauer. I can characterize this accurately,
does recognize the need and supports adding staff, but doesn't want to tie the sales tax funding to
that item.
131
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:42.319
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: And the other recommendation is to reserve the revenue.
What we would count as revenue in this fiscal year until the full year situation on our revenues and
expenses becomes more clear, so the policy would take effect
132
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.850
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: as of
133
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.190
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Fy. 20,
134
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:57.480
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: 5, 26. And if we are able to spend more of it this year, then
we can revisit that in the budget process. But we want to make sure we're going to end up in a
satisfactory place this year before committing the funds beyond
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
135
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.999
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: relatively early in the fiscal year. That's all I have.
136
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:10.680
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Thank you very much. Turning to the Budget Committee.
Anything that the Budget Committee would like to add in as a presentation piece.
137
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.310
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: No, that was that was a good summary by the general
manager.
138
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:33.770
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Okay, then we at this point are at the time for questions
from council members. So we'll deal with questions on this item, and then we'll go out to the public
for public comment and come back for discussion. So questions, anyone want to start here?
Council members.
139
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.890
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: I will go ahead and ask on this. On this staff report
140
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.760
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: I see these various suggestions are
141
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:53.919
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: they? Is is the recommendation that all 4 of these
proposals be accepted? Or are these alternative proposals?
142
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.549
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: You know I I would characterize them as a
recommendation.
143
00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:03.130
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: From staff, realizing there's all kinds of different
possibilities and permutations here.
144
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.840
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: I would say that the
145
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:15.299
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the strongest recommendation would be to probably go in
and reverse order. Number 4 is, don't spend the money until we know what the fiscal situation is
like
146
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:20.780
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the 3rd one would probably be the softest if you will. I
think that Council Member Mauer, has a really
147
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.780
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: important perspective and legitimate point here about.
148
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.619
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: You know that the money can easily be spent on the other
purposes, so I'm not sure it would even be available.
149
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.979
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: but I I don't feel personally, very strongly about that one
150
00:20:35.695 --> 00:20:42.239
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: number continuing reverse order, retaining public safety
was a very high priority
151
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:51.889
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: for the residents in the survey and the polling. So that's in
part, while that why, that is as high as it is, as well as public safety being a foundational
requirement.
152
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:58.350
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: an expectation of local government. And then we know our
infrastructure needs attention. That was also very highly ranked
153
00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.749
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: in the polling and survey that we did. And it's also been
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
154
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:10.210
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: something that council members have recognized. The
one thing I would say on that that's kind of emerging, and this is, thanks to Dante del Prete is the
importance
155
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.310
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: and the it's kind of out of sight, out of mind. But our
drainage system, our storm water system, does need help and attention.
156
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.269
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: and with significant dollars in the coming years. That's why
that one is called out and included in here.
157
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:35.491
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Okay, so, as I understand it, the recommendation is that
tax sales tax revenue collected during the remainder of this fiscal year be held, and a decision
about that tranche of money.
158
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:50.900
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: wait for the end of the fiscal year, and that as to the next
tranche of sales tax would be 2526, fiscal year, a 3rd go to infrastructure needs of roads, streets,
drainage, and parks.
159
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.349
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: I note that in the other categories you haven't specified a
percentage.
160
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:04.329
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: Was there a recommended percentage, or just that these
other categories be considered and prioritized?
161
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.886
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: So for
162
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:21.840
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: in terms of the staff recommendation or budget
committee in terms of the the. So there's a 3rd of the sales tax to high priority infrastructure, and
then, it's noted, retain extin existing level of staffing. And consider staffing needs after completion.
163
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.489
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: If a 3rd is allocated to infrastructure, is there a
recommended allocation to these other categories? Or is it just prioritizing them?
164
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:38.610
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: It's just prioritizing it. And basically, what this I think
means in practice is that if we had to
165
00:22:39.305 --> 00:22:41.000
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: make reductions in
RAW Transcript of Zoom Recording From City Council Meeting
166
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.830
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: the city and budget at some point that
167
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:54.489
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: even after the sales tax that we would make retaining the
police and fire funding. A very high priority, including using the sales tax proceeds if we needed to.
168
00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:02.570
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: That's 1 approach to it. Another approach, which I think is
also perfectly legitimate is to say, we're going to dedicate a certain percentage
169
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.250
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: to place and fire.
170
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:11.039
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: But if that isn't necessary to retain the existing staff, the
essential staffing essentially allows us to release
171
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.939
Sebastopol Community Cultural Center: certain amount of dollars to the to the general fund.
172
00:23:14.447 --> 00:23:17.829
